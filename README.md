# Employee-Management-System
This project demonstrates how to use C++ to implement a polymorphism-based Employee Management System.
It showcases object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

# 🚀 Overview
The system manages company employees who are divided into three categories:
<ul>
  <li>Ordinary Employees – Complete tasks assigned by managers.</li>
  <li>Managers – Complete tasks assigned by the boss and assign tasks to employees.</li>
  <li>Boss – Oversee and manage the overall company operations.</li>
</ul>


When displaying employee information, the system shows:
<ul>
  <li>Employee ID</li>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Position</li>
  <li>Job responsibilities</li>
</ul>

# 🧩 System Features
<ul>
  <li>Exit System – Exit the management system.</li>
  <li>Add Employee – Add new employees and save their information (ID, name, and department number) to a file.</li>
  <li>Display Employees – View all employee details in the company.</li>
  <li>Delete Employee – Remove an employee record using their employee ID.</li>
  <li>Modify Employee – Update employee information using their ID.</li>
  <li>Find Employee – Search employees by ID or name.</li>
  <li>Sort Employees – Sort employee records by ID.</li>
  <li>Clear All Data – Delete all employee records from the file (requires confirmation to avoid accidental deletion).</li>
</ul>

# ⚙️ Technologies Used
<ul>
  <li>Language: C++</li>
  <li>Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling, Polymorphism</li>
  <li>Compiler: g++</li>
  <li>IDE: Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>
